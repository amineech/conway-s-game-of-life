Conway's Game Of Life

- The implementation of the game was part of a university course (Object Oriented Programming in Java and UML) !
- we were provided with a basic skeleton of the code to accelerate the development of the project (by Mr. Frederic ARMETTA - Lyon 1 university - LIRIS)

- Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton created by the British mathematician John Conway in 1970. It's a zero-player game that simulates the evolution of a grid of cells based on simple rules. Despite its simplicity, the Game of Life is known for producing complex patterns and behaviors that can resemble the dynamics of biological life.
- We implemented the game using Java as a programming langage and the Swing library, the UI is basic, but we focused on the complex calculation of the grid and the evolution of cells with time without slowing down the game (threads)
